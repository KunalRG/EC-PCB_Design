# EC-PCB_Design
This project focuses on designing PCB for water level indication
In the field of electronics it is very important to design and create your own PCB(Printed Circuit Board).PCB help to optimise your circuit connections.
There is huge demand of designing a small sized PCB in the field of robotics,microcontroller,etc.
So,I hope this project will help to understand basics of designing PCB.
Thank you and keep leaning.
